reporter-rhtsupport(1)
======================

NAME
----
reporter-rhtsupport - Reports problem to RHTSupport.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-rhtsupport' [-v] [-c CONFFILE] [-F FMTFILE] [-u -C UR_CONFFILE] -d DIR

Or:

'reporter-rhtsupport' [-v] [-c CONFFILE] [-d DIR] -t[ID] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads problem directory DIR. Then it logs in to RHTSupport
and creates a new case.

The URL to new case is printed to stdout and recorded in 'reported_to'
element in DIR.

If not specified, CONFFILE defaults to /etc/libreport/plugins/rhtsupport.conf
and to user's local ~/.config/libreport/rhtsupport.conf.
User's local configuration overrides the system wide configuration.

Option -t uploads FILEs to the already created case on RHTSupport site.
The case ID is retrieved from directory specified by -d DIR.
If problem data in DIR was never reported to RHTSupport, you will be asked
to enter case ID to which you want to upload the FILEs.

Option -tCASE uploads FILEs to the case CASE on RHTSupport site.
-d DIR is ignored.
