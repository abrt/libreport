====================

NAME
----
reporter-bugzilla - Reports problem to Bugzilla.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-bugzilla' [-vbf] [-g GROUP]... [-c CONFFILE]... [-F FMTFILE] [-A FMTFILE2] -d DIR

Or:

'reporter-bugzilla' [-v] [-c CONFFILE]... [-d DIR] -t[ID] FILE...

Or:

'reporter-bugzilla' [-v] [-c CONFFILE]... [-d DIR] -t[ID] -w

Or:

'reporter-bugzilla' [-v] [-c CONFFILE]... -h DUPHASH

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads problem directory DIR. Then it logs in to Bugzilla
and tries to find a bug with the same abrt_hash:HEXSTRING in 'Whiteboard'.

If such bug is not found, then a new bug is created. Elements of DIR
are stored in the bug as part of bug description or as attachments,
depending on their type and size.

Otherwise, if such bug is found and it is marked as CLOSED DUPLICATE,
the tool follows the chain of duplicates until it finds a non-DUPLICATE bug.
The tool adds a new comment to found bug.

The URL to new or modified bug is printed to stdout and recorded in
'reported_to' element in DIR.

Option -t uploads FILEs to the already created bug on Bugzilla site.
The bug ID is retrieved from directory specified by -d DIR.
If problem data in DIR was never reported to Bugzilla, upload will fail.

Option -tID uploads FILEs to the bug with specified ID on Bugzilla site.
-d DIR is ignored.

Option -w adds bugzilla user to bug's CC list.

Option -r sets the last url from reporter_to element which is prefixed with
TRACKER_NAME to URL field. This option is applied only when a new bug is to be
filed. The default value is 'ABRT Server'"

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If not specified, CONFFILE defaults to /etc/libreport/plugins/bugzilla.conf.
Configuration file lines should have 'PARAM = VALUE' format. The parameters are:

'Login'::
	Login to Bugzilla account.

'Password'::
	Password to Bugzilla account.

'BugzillaURL'::
	Bugzilla HTTP(S) address. (default: https://bugzilla.redhat.com)

'SSLVerify'::
	Use yes/true/on/1 to verify server's SSL certificate. (default: yes)

'Product'::
	Product bug field value. Useful if you needed different product than specified in /etc/os-release

'ProductVersion'::
	Version bug field value. Useful if you needed different product version than specified in /etc/os-release

Parameters can be overridden via $Bugzilla_PARAM environment variables.

Formatting configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lines starting with # are ignored.

Lines can be continued on the next line using trailing backslash.

Format:

   "%summary:: summary format"
   "section:: element1[,element2]..."
   The literal text line to be added to Bugzilla comment. Can be empty.
   (Empty lines are NOT ignored!)

   Summary format is a line of text, where %element% is replaced by
   text element's content, and [[...%element%...]] block is used only if
   %element% exists. [[...]] blocks can nest.

   Sections can be:
   - %summary: bug summary format string.
   - %attach: a list of elements to attach.
   - text, double colon (::) and the list of comma-separated elements.

   Elements can be:
   - problem directory element names, which get formatted as
     <element_name>: <contents>
     or
     <element_name>:
     :<contents>
     :<contents>
     :<contents>
   - problem directory element names prefixed by "%bare_",
     which is formatted as-is, without "<element_name>:" and colons
   - %oneline, %multiline, %text wildcards, which select all corresponding
     elements for output or attachment
   - %binary wildcard, valid only for %attach section, instructs to attach
     binary elements
   - problem directory element names prefixed by "-",
     which excludes given element from all wildcards

     Nonexistent elements are silently ignored.
     If none of elements exists, the section will not be created.
