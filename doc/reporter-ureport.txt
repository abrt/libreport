NAME
----
reporter-ureport - Reports ABRT problems in format of micro report

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-ureport' [-v] [-c CONFFILE] [-u URL] [-k] [-A -a bthash -B -b bug-id -E -e email] [-r] [-d DIR]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads problem directory DIR, assembles an micro report from the loaded
problem data and sends the micro report to uReport server for updating
statistics and fast analysis. The results of the analysis are stored in problem
data in form of problems elements. 'reporter-ureport' updates 'reported_to'

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If not specified, CONFFILE defaults to /etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf.
Configuration file lines should have 'PARAM = VALUE' format. The parameters are:

'URL'::
   Base sever HTTP(S) address.

'SSLVerify'::
   Use no/false/off/0 to disable verification of server's SSL certificate. (default: yes)

'SSLClientAuth'::
   If this option is set, client-side SSL certificate is used to authenticate
   to the server so that it knows which machine it came from. Assigning any value to
   this option changes the default value of IncludeAuthData to yes.

   Possible values are:

   'rhsm';;
      Uses the system certificate that is used for Red Hat subscription management.

   'puppet';;
      Uses the certificate that is used by the Puppet configuration management tool.

   '<cert_path>:<key_path>';;
      Manually supply paths to certificate and the corresponding key in PEM format.

'ContactEmail'::
   Email address attached to a bthash on the server.

'IncludeAuthData'::
   If this option is set to 'yes', uploaded uReport will contain 'auth' object
   consisting from key value pairs made from CSV list stored in 'AuthDataItems'
   option. Keys are file names and values are bites of these files.

   The default value is no, unless you set SSLClientAuth to some value. In that
   case, the default value is yes.

'AuthDataItems'::
   CSV list of files included in the 'auth' uReport object.

Parameters can be overridden via $uReport_PARAM environment variables.
