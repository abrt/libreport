NAME
----
reporter-mailx - Sends contents of a problem directory via email.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'reporter-mailx' [-v] -d DIR [-c CONFFILE] [-F FMTFILE]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The tool reads a problem directory, composes an email message
from the directory contents, and uses mailx to send the message to
specified recipient.

Properties of email messages can be specified in a configuration file,
and via environment variables.

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration file contains entries in a format "Option = Value".

The options are:

'Subject'::
       The subject of the email message.

'EmailFrom'::
       The sender of the email message.

'EmailTo'::
       The recipient of the email message.

'SendBinaryData'::
       Use yes/true/on/1 to attach all binary files from the problem
       directory to the email. This can cause the emails to be very
       large.

Formatting configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lines starting with # are ignored.

Lines can be continued on the next line using trailing backslash.

Format:

   "%summary:: subject format"
   "section:: element1[,element2]..."
   The literal text line to be added to email. Can be empty.
   (Empty lines are NOT ignored!)

   Subject format is a line of text, where %element% is replaced by
   text element's content, and [[...%element%...]] block is used only if
   %element% exists. [[...]] blocks can nest.

   Sections can be:
   - %summary: email subject format string.
   - %attach: a list of elements to attach.
   - text, double colon (::) and the list of comma-separated elements.

   Elements can be:
   - problem directory element names, which get formatted as
     <element_name>: <contents>
     or
     <element_name>:
     :<contents>
     :<contents>
     :<contents>
   - problem directory element names prefixed by "%bare_",
     which is formatted as-is, without "<element_name>:" and colons
   - %oneline, %multiline, %text wildcards, which select all corresponding
     elements for output or attachment
   - %binary wildcard, valid only for %attach section, instructs to attach
     binary elements
   - problem directory element names prefixed by "-",
     which excludes given element from all wildcards

     Nonexistent elements are silently ignored.
     If none of elements exists, the section will not be created.


Integration with ABRT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'reporter-mailx' can be used as a reporter, to allow users report
problems via email when they decide to do it. This usage is
pre-configured in /etc/libreport/events.d/mailx_event.conf:

------------
EVENT=report_Mailx      reporter-mailx
------------

It can also be used to notify administrator automatically when a
problem happens. When this is desired, modify the event configuration
file to run the tool on the 'post-create' event:

------------
EVENT=post-create       reporter-mailx
------------

OPTIONS
-------
-d DIR::
   Path to problem directory.

-c CONFFILE::
   Path to configuration file. When used in ABRT event system, the file
   contains site-wide configuration. Users can change the values via
   environment variables.

-F CONF_FORMAT_FILE
   Formatting file for an email.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
Environment variables take precedence over values provided in
the configuration file.

'Mailx_Subject'::
       Subject of the email message.

'Mailx_EmailFrom'::
       Sender of the email message.

'Mailx_EmailTo'::
       Recipient of the email message. If nor the environment variable
       nor the corresponding option is defined, the message is send to
       "root@localhost".

'Mailx_SendBinaryData'::
       Use yes/true/on/1 to attach all binary files from the problem
       directory to the email.
