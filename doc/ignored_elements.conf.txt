ignored_elements.conf(5)
========================

NAME
----
ignored_elements.conf - configuration file for libreport.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file specifies which elements should *NOT* be checked
for sensitive data during the process of reporting a problem. This means
that, for the elements specified in this file, no words will be highlighted
in the User Interface (UI). See also report-gtk(1).

Only elements that are known not to contain sensitive data should be on this
list.

Custom search in the UI ignores this list and works with all elements.

The configuration format is one line per ignored element.

Users can provide own file with the list of ignored elements which will be
appended to the list of ignored elements loaded from
/etc/libreport/ignored_elements.conf

EXAMPLES
--------
System configuration:

/etc/libreport/ignored_elements.conf

    cpuinfo
    open_fds

User configuration:

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/abrt/settings/ignored_elements.conf
