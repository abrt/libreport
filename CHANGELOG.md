debug info downloader to be able to download debug info packages for the
version of operating system captured in problem details.

clients to force libreport to always report problems regardless of possible
sensitive data leaks and report usability concerns.

### Changed

words.

in Fedora workflows.

### Fixed
- Start controlling logging verbosity through ABRT_VERBOSE in the reportclient
python module.
- Test processes for own root by checking /proc/1/root instead of / to be able
to run libreport code in a container or a changed root environment.
- Fix formatting of the configuration format in 'man reporter-mailix'.
- Refuse to parse negative number as unsigned int when parsing configuration
files.
- Correctly detect errors by resetting errno to no error before calling
functions reporting errors through errno.
