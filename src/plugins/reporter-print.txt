-----------
The tool reads dump directory DIR and prints its text representation
to stdout or to a specified FILE.

Integration with ABRT events

to report problems by writinf them to a file. Example:

   If -o FILE is specified, controls whether FILE is appended to, or
   overwritten. (default: no)

-r::
   Add a record to 'reported_to' in DIR which specifies that this

   problems which were and weren't yet reported.

only one line are printed in the form
